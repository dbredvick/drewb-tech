I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer for [Leafly.com](https://www.leafly.com). I love solving consumers' problems and building e-commerce solutions. 

I grew up in a small town in Western Nebraska. I got hooked on electronics at a young age when my dad and I assembled a computer together when I was in fourth grade. My tech love started with video games: first playing them, then trying to hack them, and finally trying to build them. Fourteen years later, I still play video games in my spare time. I found a career in something similar - solving puzzles on the computer. In the day you can find me at your local coffee shop checking r/all on Reddit. I spend my nights checking out the latest JavaScript news and throwing together a new "Hello, World!" application with the latest tech.
