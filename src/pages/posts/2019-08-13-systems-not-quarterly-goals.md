Time for your one-on-one with your manager to set next quarter’s goals. Quickly come up with some idea you *think* is worth doing over the next 90 days. 

...

Now it’s the end of the quarter. **Congrats**! You accomplished one of your goals but fell short in the other two. How do you feel? If the answer is *”ehhhh*”, it might be because this system isn’t for you. 

### The problem with goal setting

It lets us down. Either you accomplish your goal or you don’t. In either scenario, the happiness lasts for at most one day. If you want to succeed, you need to find a way to be happy even through the failed goals.

## **Here’s how to win even when you fail at your goals.**

Make systems that let you progress towards your goal. Then follow that system. Adhering to that system is your new measurement of success. 

## Tech

Publish pull requests and get feedback 2x a week, not become a stronger NodeJS developer. 

Meet weekly with a senior/principal developer to get feedback, not become a senior developer. 

Publish my architecture diagrams and system flows and gather feedback, not become better at system architecture. 

## Business

Publish a blog post weekly, not have a successful blog with 100,000 readers. 

Publish a new product version once a month and gather feedback, not make $5,000 a month in revenue. 

Publish a weekly podcast, not have 10,000 podcast listeners. 

## Finances

Ride my bike to work every day, not save money on Uber this month. 

Meal prep my lunches for the week, not cut cost by 50% on eating out. 

## personal life

Workout 4x a week, not gain 5 lbs of muscle

Call my family once a week, not have a close family relationship.
